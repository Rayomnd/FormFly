FormFly is a demo for Rails 3 that uses DragonFly and Uploadify

This version uses a technique where intermediary images are saved to a separate ImageUpload model while the server waits for the Post to be submitted.


To Install:

$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails s

Go to localhost:3000

TODO:

1) Get it to work properly in production mode

2) Use Tempfile

3) Add video support
